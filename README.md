     HOW TO USE THIS FILE

     This is your submission. Fill each section in as you finish the milestone
     it belongs to — don't leave it all to the end.

     Unit 3 asks for the first five sections. Unit 4 adds the five below them.
     Leave the unit 4 sections alone until then; they're here so you know
     what's coming.

     Everything is pasted as TEXT. No screenshots, no images, no video links.
     A typed block of output gets full credit; a picture of the same output
     gets none.

<!-- ═══════════════════════ UNIT 3 — THE BUILD ═══════════════════════ -->

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences: what a user asks for, and what they get back. -->

FitFindr helps users find secondhand clothing. A user types in a requested item in plain language, such as "vintage graphic tee under $30, size M". The app finds the best matching item from a dataset of provided listings. It generates one or two outfits that combine it with pieces from the user's wardrobe. The app then follows up with a social-media-friendly caption that can be shared in a post. If no matching item is found, the agent stops and asks the user to broaden the search.

---

## Tool Inventory

<!-- Four lines per tool. This is worth 2 points and it's the single most
     common place students lose them.

     "Returns a list" earns NOTHING. The description has to say what is IN
     the list.

     The empty case isn't optional either — it's the thing your loop branches
     on, and if you don't decide it here you'll discover it as a crash in
     Milestone 5. -->

### `search_listings`

- **What it does:**
Searches the listings dataset for items matching a description, with an optional size, and an optional maximum price. Size matches on whole words and max_price is inclusive.
- **Inputs:** <!-- name and type each: `max_price` (float), not "a price" -->
description (str), size (str | None), max_price (float | None)
- **Returns:**
A list of matching listing dictionaries, sorted by relevance. Each listing contains id, title, description, category, style_tags (list), size, condition, price (float), colors (list), brand (str | None), and platform.
- **When it has nothing:**
Returns an empty list when nothing matches, including when the size or price filters rule everything out. Never None.

### `suggest_outfit`

- **What it does:**
Uses a selected listing and the user's wardrobe to generate outfit suggestions with the model.
- **Inputs:**
new_item (dict), wardrobe (dict)
- **Returns:**
A non-empty string with outfit suggestions, including specific items from the user's wardrobe.
- **When it has nothing:**
Returns general styling advice, and states that they are general, because there is no wardrobe saved.

### `create_fit_card`

- **What it does:**
Creates a short social-media-style caption describing the selected item and suggested outfit. The caption is different each time it is run.
- **Inputs:**
outfit (str), new_item (dict)
- **Returns:**
A two-to-four sentence caption string that names the item, the price, and the platform.
- **When it has nothing:**
If outfit is empty, returns a descriptive message instead of calling the model. If the model returns nothing, returns a message saying so rather than an empty string.

## Planning Loop

<!-- Your branch rule, stated as a rule — the condition AND both paths — plus
     the file and function that holds it.

     Like this:
       "If search_listings returns an empty list, put a message in the session
        and stop. Otherwise take the first result and go to suggest_outfit."
        — agent.py::run_agent

     The grader checks your code against what you claim here, so the file and
     function have to be real. -->

**Branch rule:**
If search_listings returns an empty list, store a message in the session and stop the agent. Otherwise, store the first result from the list of matching dictionaries, and continue to suggest_outfit. After generating the outfit suggestions, store them in the session, and continue to create_fit_card.

**Where it lives:** `agent.py::run_agent`

**How the query is parsed:** <!-- regex, string splitting, or asking the model — say which -->
The query will be parsed by asking the model. It will find the description, an optional size, and an optional maximum price, and store them in the session before search_listings is called.

**What moves through the session:** <!-- which fields, in what order -->
The parsed description, size, and maximum price are stored in the session and passed to search_listings. The selected listing from search_listings is stored in the session and passed to suggest_outfit. The outfit suggested by suggest_outfit is stored in the session and passed to create_fit_card. The caption generated by create_fit_card is also stored in the session and returned to the user.

## Sample Run

<!-- Two things go here.

     1. One FULL query and its output, pasted as text.
     2. Your three per-tool terminal tests — the command and what it printed. -->

**One full query**

```
$ python app.py ask 'vintage graphic tee under $30'

  Found:    Y2K Baby Tee — Butterfly Print — $18.0 on depop

  Outfit:   Here are two outfit suggestions using the Y2K Baby Tee and pieces from your wardrobe:

**Outfit 1: Casual Streetwear (Y2K & Edgy)**
*   **Top:** Y2K Baby Tee — Butterfly Print
*   **Bottoms:** Baggy straight-leg jeans, dark wash
*   **Outerwear:** Black cropped zip hoodie
*   **Shoes:** Chunky white sneakers
*   **Accessories:** Black crossbody bag

*Why it works:* The fitted crop of the baby tee balances the volume of the baggy dark-wash jeans. Layering the black cropped zip hoodie on top keeps the silhouette short and fitted at the waist while leaning into the Y2K streetwear aesthetic, finished off with chunky sneakers and a crossbody bag.

**Outfit 2: Contrast Mix (Earth Tones & Vintage)**
*   **Top:** Y2K Baby Tee — Butterfly Print
*   **Bottoms:** Wide-leg khaki trousers
*   **Outerwear:** Vintage black denim jacket (slightly cropped)
*   **Shoes:** Black combat boots
*   **Accessories:** Brown leather belt

*Why it works:* This outfit pairs the ultra-feminine, pastel butterfly tee with the structured, minimal earth tones of the wide-leg khaki trousers and brown belt. Throwing on the vintage black denim jacket and black combat boots adds a touch of grunge, grounding the sweet Y2K top with classic, tougher textures.

  Fit card: Scoreeee! Just scored this vintage butterfly baby tee on depop for $18, and I am obsessed with how it looks dressed down with baggy dark denim and a zip hoodie for the ultimate Y2K street style.

1 model calls this session, 2 served from cache, 443 prompt + 45 output tokens
```

**The three tools, tested one at a time**

```

$ python -c "from tools import search_listings; print(search_listings('graphic tee', max_price=30))"

```

```

$ python -c "from tools import suggest_outfit; from utils.data_loader import get_example_wardrobe, load_listings; print(suggest_outfit(load_listings()[0], get_example_wardrobe()))"


```

Here are two outfit suggestions combining the vintage Levi's 501 jeans with pieces from your wardrobe:

**Outfit 1: Casual Streetwear**
*   **Bottoms:** Vintage Levi's 501 Jeans — Medium Wash
*   **Top:** White ribbed tank top
*   **Outerwear:** Vintage black denim jacket
*   **Shoes:** Chunky white sneakers
*   **Accessories:** Black crossbody bag

*Why it works:* This creates a classic denim-on-denim look by pairing the medium wash Levi's with the slightly cropped black denim jacket. Tucking in the fitted white ribbed tank adds balance to the structured denim, while the chunky white sneakers and black crossbody bag keep the outfit casual and streetwear-ready.

**Outfit 2: Cozy & Grunge-Influenced**
*   **Bottoms:** Vintage Levi's 501 Jeans — Medium Wash
*   **Top:** Black cropped zip hoodie
*   **Shoes:** Black combat boots
*   **Accessories:** Brown leather belt, Black crossbody bag

*Why it works:* The straight-leg 501s pair effortlessly with the edge of the black combat boots, tied together with the brown leather belt at the waist. Layering the cropped black zip hoodie keeps the top proportion compact while letting the vintage wash of the jeans stand out.

```

$ python -c "from tools import create_fit_card; from utils.data_loader import load_listings; print(create_fit_card('jeans and white sneakers', load_listings()[0]))"

```

Scored these vintage Levi's 501 jeans on depop for $38 and I am never taking them off. Threw them on with crisp white sneakers for theultimate effortless running-errands-in-Brooklyn look. Perfect medium wash and the fit is genuinely unmatched.

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. What you asked, what came back, what you changed.

     "I used Claude to help me code" is not enough.

     "I gave Claude my search_listings spec. It returned None on no match
     instead of an empty list, so I changed it" is the level we want. -->

**Moment 1**

- *What I asked for:*
I asked Claude to review my search_listings implementation and the size-filtering logic.
- *What came back:*
Claude proposed a more complex matching approach intended to handle specific size formats found within the dataset. The logic seemed complicated and hard to review, explain, or maintain.
- *What I changed:*
I changed the size filtering to use whole-word matching and documented that behavior in the Tool Inventory. The goal was to continue to avoid matching "S" on "US" while simplifying the behavior.

**Moment 2**

- *What I asked for:*
I asked Claude to fill in run_agent following the branch rule in the README.
- *What came back:*
An implementation that relied on a string splitter that read "size X" and "under $N" from the query. It ran correctly, but appeared to be restricted by a rigid format in the provided query.
- *What I changed:*
I switched the parser to use a model based approach. I added instructions for model to convert sizes to uppercase abbreviations, prices to numbers, and follow a provided example format for its response.

     Don't fill these in during unit 3.

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Five criteria, five tries each, in this exact format.

     Five, because your criteria are written out of five. Mark each try PASS
     or FAIL, count the passes, and read that count against your target — a
     row targeting 4 of 5 with three PASS cells is MISSED (3/5).

     `python run_eval.py --label before` runs everything and writes the table
     into results/. Paste it here and fill in the verdicts. -->

| Criterion | Target | Try 1 | Try 2 | Try 3 | Try 4 | Try 5 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Real output from one try**, pasted as text, naming the file and function
that produced it:

## Verdicts and Diagnoses

<!-- MET or MISSED per criterion against LAST UNIT's target, plus a sentence on
     how you decided.

     Then, for every miss: which of the four places it happened — a tool, the
     loop's branch, the session, or the model's output — AND the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis:  "The fit card was bad."
     A diagnosis:      "The fit card criterion missed on 2 of 5 items. Both had
                        an empty brand field. My prompt puts the brand in the
                        first sentence, so the card opened with a blank and read
                        like a fragment. The tool worked; the prompt assumed a
                        field that isn't always there."

     Look for a pattern. Three misses on the same tool is one problem, not
     three. -->

| # | Criterion | Target | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |  |

## Loop Trace

<!-- One full run, printed step by step, with the MCP call visible in it.

     `python app.py ask '...' --trace` once you've added the trace.step()
     calls in Milestone 2.

     Worth pasting BOTH the happy path and the empty-search path. The empty
     one should be visibly shorter, because it stops. If your two traces are
     the same length, your branch isn't working — and this is the fastest way
     anyone will ever find that out. -->

**Happy path**

```

```

**Empty search**

```

```

**On the MCP move:** <!-- what changed in your code, and whether anything
behaved differently afterwards. If the rewire didn't work, say exactly where it
broke — the error text and the last thing that worked. That earns the point in
full. -->



---

## The Improvement

<!-- What you changed, why your diagnosis pointed at it, and the after-run in
     the same table format. One change, measured properly.

     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

**What I changed:**

**Which failure it was meant to fix:**

### Run Log — After

| Criterion | Target | Try 1 | Try 2 | Try 3 | Try 4 | Try 5 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Did it help, and how do I know:**

<!-- If it made things worse, say that. Honestly reported, that earns full
     credit and is more interesting than one that worked. -->



---

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed: what you'd do, and why you stopped where
     you did. "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is
     left is not. -->
